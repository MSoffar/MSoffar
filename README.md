# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mohamed Soffar!

**Senior Student | University of Alexandria**  
**Major: Computer Engineering | Minor: Artificial Intelligence**

Welcome to my corner of GitHub! I'm not just passionate about coding—I'm having fun turning complex problems into smart, AI-powered solutions. Whether it’s **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Computer Vision**, or building **chatbots**, I’m always up for a challenge. 🚀

## 🔥 What I’m Currently Geeking Out On:
- **LLMs & RAG:** Creating intelligent systems that think fast and fetch smarter.
- **AI Applications:** From brainwaves to code, I love transforming ideas into **intelligent applications**.
- **End-to-End Chatbots:** Crafting bots that don’t just talk—they **learn** and adapt!
- **Web Deployments:** Making AI accessible through slick platforms with **Django**, **Flask**, and **Streamlit**.

## ⚙️ My Stack:
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Java
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
- **Web Frameworks:** Django, Flask, Streamlit
- **Specialties:** LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), NLP, Computer Vision


## 💡 Fun Facts:
- I'm always up for a coding challenge—because what's life without a little **debugging adventure**?
- When I'm not coding, I'm probably thinking about how I could automate it! 😄
